# CoulombHelper
A small algorithm that helps visualize and calculate for you the Law of Coulomb in real time!

Work with multiple point charges, and how they affect each other in space.

Move the point charges around, give different data, inspect the results.

Particle Visualizer is WIP (with the help of my lovely game engine [tleng](https://github.com/tl-ecosystem/tleng))
